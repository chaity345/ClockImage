<!-- note for this clock image setup

the top property
When position is set to absolute or fixed, the top property specifies the distance between the element's outer margin of the top edge and the inner border of the top edge of its containing block, or, in the case of anchor positioned elements when the anchor() function is used within the value, relative to the specified <anchor-side> edge. The top property is compatible with the top, bottom, start, end, self-start, self-end, center, and <percentage> values.
